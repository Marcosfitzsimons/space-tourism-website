### What I learned

#### Accesibility:

- aria-hidden ---> removes that element and all of its children from the accessibility tree. (NavLinks numbers - SectionTitle numbers)
- aria-selected attribute ---> to indicates the current "selected" tab
- sr-only ---> to hide an element visually without hiding it from screen readers

Switch between each page with React Router DOM v6.3
